         My clinical and academic work focuses on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 
        metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), advanced endoscopy, 
        and artificial intelligence applications in gastroenterology.

        I am particularly interested in real-world data analysis, elastography-based risk stratification, 
        and AI-driven endoscopic quality improvement.
